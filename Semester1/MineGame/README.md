## Run Locally

### Clone the project

First, clone the Mine Game project repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or a Unix-based terminal), and run the following command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/KvasirSG/Mine-Game
```

### Go to the project directory

Change into the project directory that was just cloned to your local machine:

```bash
  cd Mine-Game
```

### Install Java (If not already installed)

Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. You can check by running `java -version` in your terminal. If you don't have Java installed, download and install it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.

### Open the project in an IDE

Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.).
### Build the project

Use your IDE's build feature to compile the project. This is usually done through a menu option like `Build` > `Build Project` or a similar command.

### Run the project

Finally, run the project by right-clicking on the `MineGame.java` file in your IDE and selecting the option to run it. In IntelliJ IDEA, for example, this option is `Run 'MineGame.main()'`. This will start the game.
